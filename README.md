- 👋 Hi, I’m @JHerro2
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, maths and health
- 🌱 I’m currently learning / technically enrolled in biomedical engineering at UTS, however I thought having an undergraduate in software engineering and adding biotechnology 
would be a marketable combo. Even though it is going to take a really long time to graduate (i'll probably be 23-24 hopefully (i'm almost 21 right now)), I still think these are great degrees. Depsite the fact that 
I want to study pharmacy, i think it's a safer decision to study a strong engineering/technology-related area as a fallback. I'm actually not too great at computing, but I'm adamant to learn
and I'd love to find internships in this area ASAP. Hopefully it won't be too late to study pharmacy if I'm in my mid-20s :( It's a harsh reality... but I mean everything takes time and things won't just
spontaneously and miraculously happen over night. I really hope I won't get burnt-out by this... if I do this semester, I won't hesitate to change back to the weaker BME or do BsciIT (both are still sound degrees at least)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... SES1b - not too sure
- 📫 How to reach me ...
